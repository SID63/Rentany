# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves rebranding the existing Rent Pal application to Rent Any and preparing it for deployment on Vercel. The rebrand should encompass all visual elements, naming conventions, and branding materials while ensuring the application is optimized for Vercel's deployment platform. The project should also be prepared for Git version control with proper repository structure and deployment configurations.

## Requirements

4. WHEN examining environment variables THEN the system SHALL use RENT_ANY prefix where applicable
5. WHEN reviewing comments and documentation THEN the system SHALL reference "Rent Any" instead of "Rent Pal"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be properly configured for Vercel deployment, so that I can deploy it seamlessly to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the system SHALL include a proper vercel.json configuration file
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL generate optimized static assets for Vercel
3. WHEN accessing environment variables THEN the system SHALL properly handle Vercel's environment variable system
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL be compatible with Vercel's serverless functions if needed
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include proper build scripts and dependencies for Vercel

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to have proper Git repository structure, so that I can manage version control and collaborate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the repository THEN the system SHALL include a comprehensive .gitignore file
2. WHEN committing code THEN the system SHALL exclude build artifacts and sensitive files
3. WHEN viewing the repository THEN the system SHALL include a proper README.md with Rent Any branding
4. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the system SHALL follow standard conventions for the chosen framework
5. WHEN setting up the repository THEN the system SHALL include proper package.json with correct metadata

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain all existing functionality while displaying the new branding, so that I can continue using the service without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any existing feature THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality as before
2. WHEN navigating the application THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing routes and navigation
3. WHEN interacting with forms THEN the system SHALL process data the same way as the original application
